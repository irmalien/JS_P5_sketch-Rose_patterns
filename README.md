# Solaris
Solaris is named after fictional mysterious planetary object in Tarkovsky 1972 movie with same title. Solaris can create endless forms of light that hypnotically capture viewers mind and imagination. Project was build with JavaScript and p5 library and expands on mathematical idea of plotting sinusoid in polar coordinates creating so called rose pattern. The expanded rose pattern captures change of shape over time with trailing motion and with mouse wheel it's possible to variate complexity of shape even further.
